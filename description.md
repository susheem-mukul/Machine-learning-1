# Machine-learning-1
In this project we have data from Ecommerce Customers website and we have to predict whether we should go for improving the company app or the company website.
The data that is provided contains the time spent on both app and website and the amount of spending in each
So by using python libraries susch as seaborn and matplotlib we did some visualizations and inferred important conclusions from it.
Then by using a linear regression model the outcome was predicted.
